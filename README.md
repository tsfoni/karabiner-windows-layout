# Windows-style Keyboard Config (Kitty + VS Code Fork + Browser)

This is a personal fork of [m3au/karabiner](https://github.com/m3au/karabiner), originally created to bring Windows-style shortcuts and behavior to macOS using Karabiner-Elements. 
The upstream repo focuses on Windows-like modifiers and navigation; this fork keeps that spirit but is vibe‑coded around a Kitty‑centric, terminal‑heavy workflow with VS Code.
